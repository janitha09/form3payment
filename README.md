# Design

* @RepositoryRestResource - is the magic
* Payment.java was generated by extracting the schema and generating a POJO from it.
* static nested classes - will not be created outside of a Payment
* Mongo - easy fit given JSON/BSON.

# How to test.

* sudo docker pull mongo
* sudo docker run -it -p 27017:27017 --name mongo mongo
* mvn clean install 

# Notes

* Embedded mongodb is commented out in the pom.xml
* application.yml files for both test and runtime are included even though they are set to the default values.
